# Information Retrieval and Web Search (BLM3120)

This is the project for the Information Retrieval and Web Search course at the Yıldız Technical University.

## Description

We intend to search multiple free stock image websites with a given keyword/topic using only one website. Since there are lots of stock image websites, we need to search every site one by one. So, we can bring these websites’ search results together with a single search.
